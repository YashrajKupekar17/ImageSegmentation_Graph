# üß† Image Segmentation App

A streamlined image processing application that performs intelligent image segmentation using **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** algorithms with Python and Streamlit. This app focuses on efficient pixel clustering for clean, accurate image segmentation.

## üöÄ Features

### üé® Smart Image Segmentation
- **DSU-based pixel clustering** with path compression and union by rank optimization
- **Multiple connectivity patterns** (4-connected or 8-connected neighbors)
- **Advanced color spaces** (RGB, HSV, LAB) for better perceptual accuracy
- **Configurable similarity thresholds** for fine-tuned segmentation control
- **Region filtering** by minimum size to remove noise
- **Distinct color visualization** for clear region identification

### üìä Essential Analytics
- **Real-time processing statistics** with performance metrics
- **Basic region analysis** (count, size distribution, processing time)
- **Compression ratio** showing segmentation efficiency
- **Clean side-by-side comparison** of original vs segmented images

### üíæ Simple Export
- **PNG image download** for segmented results
- **One-click export** with timestamped filenames
- **High-quality output** preserving segmentation details


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd image-segmentation-app
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## üéØ Usage Guide

### 1. **Image Upload**
- Use the sidebar file uploader to select an image (PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF)
- Supported formats with automatic format detection
- Instant image information display upon upload

### 2. **Segmentation Parameters**
- **Color Threshold**: Control region merging sensitivity (1-100)
  - Lower values create more detailed segments
  - Higher values merge similar regions more aggressively
- **Min Region Size**: Filter out small noise regions (1-1000 pixels)
  - Removes tiny segments that may be noise
  - Keeps only meaningful regions
- **Connectivity**: Choose 4-connected or 8-connected neighbors
  - 4-connected: Only horizontal/vertical neighbors
  - 8-connected: Includes diagonal neighbors
- **Color Space**: Select RGB, HSV, or LAB for distance calculations
  - RGB: Standard color representation
  - HSV: Better for color-based segmentation
  - LAB: Perceptually uniform color space

### 3. **Processing & Results**
- Click "üöÄ Analyze Image" to start segmentation
- View real-time processing feedback
- Compare original and segmented images side-by-side
- Review basic statistics and metrics

### 4. **Export Results**
- Download segmented image as PNG with one click
- Timestamped filenames for easy organization
- High-quality output preserving all segmentation details

## üî¨ Algorithm Details
